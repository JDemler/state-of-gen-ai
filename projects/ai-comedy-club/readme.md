# AI Comedy Club

A simple website where the user gives a topic and different text generation models reply with a joke.

Potential additional features:
- AIs respond to the output of other models creating a back and forth joke battle
- user can rate the jokes: Leaderboard of funniest AIs
- user can upload an image: models find a funny tagline to that image
- Other AIs rate how funny the jokes are

Basis: [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) with API key (I will provide you with one).
Allows you to "talk to" different text generation models through code.
