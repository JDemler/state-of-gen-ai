# Poker Game recorder

A simple website where the user can take/upload a video of a hand of poker being player gets back structured data what happend.

I assume you need to use gemini-1.5-flash-002 here to achieve the full task.
https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai?pli=1


Try to do it by hand first; take a little video, give it to google vertex ai, see if it understands it.
Or start with pictures not videos (then you can use openrouter).
Then understand how to use the google api.

Needs:
- video-to-text models
