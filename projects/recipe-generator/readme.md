# Recipe Generator

A simple website where the user can take/upload an image of ingredients they have and gets back a recipe.

First steps:
- find a model that can describe these kinds of pictures good enough (image -> text)
- find a model that can create recipies out of lists of ingredients (text -> text)
- put everything together using cursor

Potential additional features:
- Create an image of what the meal could look like

Needs:
- image-to-text models and text-to-text models

Basis: [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) with API key (I will provide you with one).
Allows you to "talk to" different text generation models through code.
